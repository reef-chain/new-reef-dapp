# create-reef-app
A sample app for reef-chain uses react-lib for easy onboarding of devs.

Use the command ``` npx create-reef-app  ``` to create a sample project, on top of which you can build your application. 
After running the command you will see instructions on the terminal itself, just like this-

On your first run - it will ask you to authorize the app to use reef-extension, also keep in mind that, you need reef browser extension installed in your browser to use this, I will be adding more features to this boilerplate and refactoring the code soon.
